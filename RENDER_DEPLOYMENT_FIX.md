# Render Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Resolution

The deployment was failing due to a complex Docker setup trying to run both Python backend and Next.js frontend simultaneously. This was causing build failures on Render's free tier.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Dockerfile
- **Removed**: Node.js, npm, and Next.js build steps
- **Focused**: Only on Python backend deployment
- **Result**: Faster, more reliable builds

### 2. Updated Configuration
- **Dockerfile**: Simplified to only handle Python backend
- **render.yaml**: Updated to use the simplified Dockerfile
- **Environment**: Set proper environment variables

## Current Setup

### Backend Only Deployment
- **Port**: 8001
- **Health Check**: `/health`
- **API Endpoints**: All backend APIs available
- **Frontend**: Can be deployed separately later

### Environment Variables
```yaml
API_HOST: 0.0.0.0
API_PORT: 8001
DEBUG: false
PORT: 8001
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**: The simplified backend should deploy successfully
2. **Test API**: Verify all endpoints work at `https://your-app.onrender.com`
3. **Frontend**: Can be deployed as a separate service later if needed

## API Endpoints Available

- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/crypto/*` - Crypto data endpoints
- `/api/stock/*` - Stock data endpoints
- `/api/ai/*` - AI analysis endpoints
- `/api/market/*` - Market data endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure the backend code is in the correct location
4. Test locally with `python backend/main.py`

## Future Enhancements

Once backend is stable:
1. Add frontend as separate service
2. Implement proper load balancing
3. Add database integration
4. Scale to paid tier for better performance
