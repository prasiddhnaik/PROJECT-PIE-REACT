I've analyzed your Financial Analytics Hub project and identified several critical issues. Here's a comprehensive breakdown with solutions:

Critical Issues Found

1\. API Key Syntax Errors in Backend

The main problem is incorrect API key formatting in main.py. The API keys are being wrapped in curly braces like variables instead of being treated as strings:

2\. Indentation Issues

The backend code has indentation problems around lines 2935-2965 that are preventing Python from parsing the file correctly.

3\. Frontend Component Errors

The RootLayout component has improper nesting of Radix UI NavigationMenu components with Next.js Link components, causing "Element type is invalid" errors.

4\. Port Conflicts

Backend: Port 8001 was already in use

Frontend: Changed from 3001 to 4000
